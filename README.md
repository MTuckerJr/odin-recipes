# odin-recipes
This is the second time attempting this recipes project. FIrst time my commits would not show any changes or updates. I will make updates to readme as I go along.

Commiting message from terminal seems to work. commiting with no message
seems to still be troublesome. I will keep trying till fix found.

[FIXED] Found the solution to the commit error no message. I needed to
re-enter (git config --global core.editor "code --wait"). Now I'm able to enter git commit wit out message and then the message window opens up.
