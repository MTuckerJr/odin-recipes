        <h4>Description</h4>
        I used to think a real beef burger was the only way. 
        This juicy piece of lean meat changed my mind. To top
        its off its healthy aswell. I promise just one wont cut it.

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground turkey, dark meat preferred or 80-90% lean</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Cracked black pepper</li>
            <li>Onion Powder</li>
            <li>Italian herb mix</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Red Onion</li>
            <li>Liquid smoke</li>
            <li>Egg</li>
            <li>Panko breadcrumbs</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Prep a baking sheet. Before you get your hands dirty, line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set it aside.</li>
            <li>Blend your ingredients. Place the ground turkey into a large mixing bowl. Add all of the patty ingredients into the bowl and, with clean hands, gently blend everything until the mixture is cohesive</li>
            <li>Form your patties! Divide the mixture into four equal portions and gently form them into patties. Place the patties on the parchment-lined baking sheet. Then with your thumb, gently press a divot into the middle of each patty—this prevents the patty from shrinking on the grill.</li>
            <li>Pop the tray of patties in the fridge and let them sit in there for about 30 minutes. Refrigerating them helps firm them up so they don’t fall apart on the grill.</li>
            <li>Time to grill! Preheat your grill to medium-high heat—around 450º F. Once the grill is hot and ready, place the patties on the grill, cover, and let them cook for about 4-5 minutes. Gently flip them (they should have nice grill marks on the cooked side), cover, and let them cook for another 4-5 minutes. At this point, check the internal temperature with a Meat Thermometer. You’re looking for an internal temperature of 165º F. If you’re not quite there yet, flip the burgers once more and cover for another minute or two. *Note: If you’re using cheese, place the cheese slices onto the patties about a minute before you think they’ll be done.</li>
            <li>Burger assembly. How you assemble your burger is completely up to you!</li>
